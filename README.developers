Readme for new devs (hopefully ;)
===================================
This is the dev-editor branch. The AI is nonworking. Levels should be loaded from a file in the Calculators
Memory. This is under construction right now. Later we want to add level-editor capabilities. This
editor will be able to send levels to another calculator with the serial connection.

If you change anything, make sure to include your name in the Copyright notice!
