Readme for new devs (hopefully ;)
===================================
This is the master branch. The AI is nonworking. Levels are loaded from huge arrays, which are built with BLC,
a tool written in C that converts level sources (found in dir levels) to *.c and *.h files. It is portable.

Developement currently happens in another branch. See the README.developers there for more infos.

If you change anything, make sure to include your name in the Copyright notice!
