BobLevelCreator
by xythobuz

This piece of software, written in portable C, takes a Level-Draft (see the
included level.txt) and converts it into .c and .h files for the game Bob.

The Level-Draft has to start with the text 'level' (without quotes). Then
follow 8 lines of text. These represent the world. It is 8 blocks high and can
be (nearly) as long as you wish. A x represents a solid block, a b is a Box
wich adds one hp and a c is a Coin. As said, look at the level.txt
